# connect-four
## Redeeming myself with Java

This project was originally a homework assignment for PIC20A, a class I took at UCLA. For the assignment, I was tasked with making a connect four app with the following features: a command-line version of the game, dumb and smart AI's, and a graphical user interface. Although the first two features came eventually with trial and error, I unfortunately was not able to get the GUI working back then.

Since school has ended, I have vowed to revisit the connect four assignment to redeem myself. After brushing up on Java and rebuilding the whole thing from scratch, what you see here is a connect four application complete with a command-line game, dumb and smart AI's, and most importantly, a graphical user interface!  

It's nice to be able sleep at night. In the future, I hope to add tougher AI, and possibly animations.
