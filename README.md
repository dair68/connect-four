# connect-four

A Java connect four application, featuring a console version of the game, smart and dumb AI's, and a GUI version of the game.

This project was originally a homework assignment for PIC20A at UCLA. Although I successfully implemented the backend, I was unfortunately not able to get the GUI working at the time. Since school ended, I have brushed up on Java and rebuilt the whole thing from scratch to give you the thing you see now.

Overall, I am pleased to have redeemed myself for PIC20A. In the future, I hope to add tougher AI and possibly even animations.
