# connect-four
A connect four game, written in java.

Originally this was a homework assignment for the PIC20A class I took at UCLA. Sadly I wasn't able to get the GUI working back then.
Now that school is over, I have rebuilt the whole thing from scratch. The project includes a command line version of connect four, 
dumb and smart AI's, and most importantly, a graphical user interface!  

In the future, I plan to add tougher AI, and possibly animations.
